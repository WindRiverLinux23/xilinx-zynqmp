2. BSP Kernel and Distros
=========================

The following table summarizes the valid Wind River Linux distros for this BSP.
'Y' in each content cell stands for supported; 'N' stands for not supported:

  +--------------+-------------+-------------+------------------+
  | valid/distro |   wrlinux   | wrlinux-cgl | wrlinux-std-sato |
  +--------------+-------------+-------------+------------------+
  |    valid     |      Y      |      N      |         Y        |
  +--------------+-------------+-------------+------------------+

For the supported kernel type for this BSP, check the TARGET_SUPPORTED_KTYPES
by running 'bitbake -e | grep "^TARGET_SUPPORTED_KTYPES"'.

Note: The preempt-rt kernel type can be used with this BSP/Machine.

3. Board Specific Patches
=========================

To get a list of patches applied to the kernel specific to this BSP along with
patch descriptions use git-whatchanged on the default kernel. For example:

	%> cd tmp-glibc/work-shared/<bsp_name>/kernel-source
	%> git whatchanged <kernel_version>/standard/base..<kernel_version>/standard/<bsp_name>


4. Boot Instructions
====================

You must load the DTB (device tree blob) into the target's memory
prior to booting the kernel Image. The DTB file can be found in the export
directory after building a project, or you can generate it manually with the
following commands:

	# bitbake -c devshell virtual/kernel
	# vim arch/arm64/boot/dts/xilinx/the_file_you_edit*.dts
	# make xilinx/zynqmp-zcu102-rev1.0.dtb

The resulting DTB file can be found here:
path_to_project/build/tmp-glibc/work/<bsp name>-wrs-linux/linux-yocto/<kernel version>/linux-<bsp name>-<kernel type>-build/arch/arm64/boot/dts/xilinx/

Assuming all files can be downloaded from a network, deploy your board and host
properly to ensure your network is available from the board.

4.1 Boot from SD card
---------------------

4.1.1 Deploy kernel, DTB image and file system image into your SD card
----------------------------------------------------------------------

Refer to the bootloader/README for information on how to make an SD
bootable card. Deploy the kernel image, DTB image and file system image as follows:

	# mount /dev/mmcblk0p2 /mnt/sd
	# tar xfj wrlinux-image-std-xilinx-zynqmp.tar.bz2 --numeric-owner -C /mnt/sd
	# umount /mnt/sd
	# mount /dev/mmcblk0p1 /mnt/sd
	# cp path_to_Image /mnt/sd/boot
	# cp path_to_zynqmp-zcu102-rev1.0.dtb /mnt/sd/boot
	# umount /mnt/sd

4.2.2 Set the u-boot environment variables and boot from SD card
----------------------------------------------------------------

Run the following command to load the kernel image and DTB image:

	=> setenv bootargs console=ttyPS0,115200 root=/dev/mmcblk0p2 rw rootwait earlycon=cdns,mmio,0xFF000000 clk_ignore_unused
	=> mmc rescan
	=> fatload mmc 0 0x10000000 Image
	=> fatload mmc 0 0x13800000 zynqmp-zcu102-rev1.0.dtb
	=> booti 0x10000000 - 0x13800000

4.2 NFS boot
------------

4.2.1 Setup configuration your NFS TFTP server, and deploy the rootfs tarball
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

	# sudo tar jxf wrlinux-image-std-sato-xilinx-zynqmp.tar.bz2 -C path_to_rootfs

4.2.2 Set the u-boot environment variables and boot from NFS
------------------------------------------------------------

	=> setenv bootargs console=ttyPS0,115200 earlycon=cdns,mmio,0xFF000000 clk_ignore_unused root=/dev/nfs rw nfsroot=serverip:path_root_rootfs ip=dhcp
	=> tftpboot 0x10000000 Image; tftpboot 0x13800000 dtb; booti 0x10000000 - 0x13800000

5. WIC Notes
============

User can use the OpenEmbedded Image Creator to create the properly partitioned
image on a SD card. It generates partitioned images from existing OpenEmbedded
build artifacts. Please refer to the following URL for more detailed partition
information about WIC:

https://docs.yoctoproject.org/singleindex.html#creating-partitioned-images-using-wic

5.1 Build WIC image within BOOT.BIN in boot partition
-----------------------------------------------------

BOOT.BIN is the bootloader for zcu102 board. Because of license issue, it isn't
integrated into WRLinux. You can download it from the website:

https://xilinx-wiki.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/A/pages/18842316/Linux+Prebuilt+Images

and then add one line below to local.conf:

IMAGE_BOOT_FILES:append = " /< path-to-BOOT.BIN >/BOOT.BIN;BOOT.BIN"

After having built your project, a partitioned WIC image will be created in the
deploy folder as follows:

  path_to_your_project/build/tmp-glibc/deploy/images/xilinx-zynqmp/wrlinux-image-<rootfs_type>-xilinx-zynqmp.wic

There are two partitions in this WIC images, the first one is to hold the boot
images(including kernel/dtb/BOOT.BIN), the second is the related root file system.

5.2 Boot the board from the WIC SD card
---------------------------------------

Insert the SD card into the board and power on, then set the proper u-boot
environment parameters to boot the board, please refer to section 4 for more
information.

Board can boot automatically by set the below uboot environment variables:

=> setenv bootfile Image; setenv fdtfile zynqmp-zcu102-rev1.0.dtb;  setenv loadaddr 0x10000000; setenv fdtaddr 0x13800000;

=> setenv bootargs 'root=/dev/mmcblk0p2 rw rootdelay=5 console=ttyPS0,115200n8'

=> setenv bootcmd 'fatload mmc 0:1 $loadaddr $bootfile; fatload mmc 0:1 $fdtaddr $fdtfile; booti $loadaddr - $fdtaddr';

=> saveenv; run bootcmd;

6. Multilib
===========

By default, this BSP is configured as a 64-bit kernel and 64-bit userspace.
If a full 32-bit filesystem is necessary, use the prefix "lib32-" before
the expected target image as follows:

	# bitbake lib32-wrlinux-image-std

7. kexec and kdump
===================

You need to add feature/kexec support as follow:
	./wrlinux-x/setup.sh --machines xilinx-zynqmp --templates feature/kexec,feature/kdump

7.1 kexec
---------

	kexec -l  /boot/Image --append="`cat /proc/cmdline`"
	kexec -e

7.2 kdump
---------

Add crashkernel=512M to the kernel cmdline
   kexec -p /boot/Image --append="$your-bootcmd"
   echo c > /proc/sysrq-trigger

Below is an example of wakeing up by console.
Run below command before entering suspend status.
	# echo enabled > /sys/devices/platform/amba/ff000000.serial/tty/ttyPS0/power/wakeup
And then, press Enter key in console window.

8.4 System Monitor
------------------

System monitor includes PL monitor and PS monitor.
Each system monitor measures voltage and temperature to provide information and alarms
to other parts of the system including the PMU, RPU, and APU processors.

Customer could check the detail system monitor interfaces with below command:
	# ls -la /sys/bus/iio/devices/iio:device0

8.5 CANFD
---------

Based on CANFD FPGA LogiCORE IP from Xilinx, there are 2 canfd devices on FPGA side.
An example is provided to verify can/canfd driver with Xilinx-zcu102 board(REV 1.0) and
FMC extend board(https://www.xilinx.com/products/boards-and-kits/1-12nths4.html)

8.5.1 Boot up system with CANFD specific dtb file
------------------------------------------------

	# fatload mmc 0 0x13000000 zynqmp-zcu102-rev1.0-canfd.dtb
	or
	# tftpboot 0x13000000 <tftp server>/zynqmp-zcu102-rev1.0-canfd.dtb

8.5.2 Verify CANFD
------------------

	Detail verification commands as below:

	# ip link set can1 up type can bitrate 125000 dbitrate 8000000 fd on
	# ip link set can2 up type can bitrate 125000 dbitrate 8000000 fd on
	# candump can1 &
	# cansend can2 5A1#11.22.33.44.55.66.77.88
	# ip -d -s link show can1
	# ip -d -s link show can2

If can1 dump data from can2, CANFD feature works fine.

There is a Xilinx Wiki link as below, it is a CANFD development guide.
It may offer some help when customer develops CANFD feature on their own platform.
https://xilinx-wiki.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/A/pages/18842496/Linux+CAN+driver

If customer wants to implement their own or more canfd devices, please connect with
Xilinx to get professional technical support about how to design CANFD on FPGA side.

8.6 USB
-------

The USB interface on the PS-side serves multiple roles as a host, device, and OTG
controller. Please change kernel options and dts file according to the descriptions
in the following link:

  https://xilinx-wiki.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/A/pages/18841729/Zynq+Ultrascale+MPSOC+Linux+USB+device+driver

And also, the USB Jumper Settings on the board ZCU102 are described below.

8.6.1 USB Host
--------------

    J109    J110    J112    J113    J7
    2-3     2-3     1-2     1-2     ON

8.6.2 USB Device
----------------

    J109    J110    J112    J113    J7
    2-3     1-2     1-2     1-2     OFF

In addition to the method which modifies "dr_mode" property in dts file, you can change this property
by using "fdt" u-boot command. The example for USB device mode is as described below:

	=> tftpboot 0x10000000 Image; tftpboot 0x13800000 dtb
	=> fdt addr 0x13800000; fdt resize; fdt set /axi/usb0@ff9d0000/dwc3@fe200000 dr_mode peripheral
	=> booti 0x10000000 - 0x13800000

8.6.3 USB OTG
-------------

    J109    J110    J112    J113    J7
    1-2     1-2     1-2     2-3     ON

The example to change "dr_mode" to "otg" is as described below:

	=> tftpboot 0x10000000 Image; tftpboot 0x13800000 dtb
	=> fdt addr 0x13800000; fdt resize; fdt set /axi/usb0@ff9d0000/dwc3@fe200000 dr_mode otg
	=> booti 0x10000000 - 0x13800000

NOTE: USB OTG mode can only work at USB2.0 speed for host & device, and file this question to
the vendor, the following link is their answer:
  https://support.xilinx.com/s/question/0D52E00006hpgaGSAQ/otg-in-zcu102-with-rev-1-0-doesnt-work-on-the-latest-sdk-v20174

8.7 PCIe
--------

Only some limited PCIe devices were supported based on the SDK2018.02 and the
following link:

  http://www.wiki.xilinx.com/ZynqMP+Linux+PCIe+Root+Port

As mentioned in this website, NVMe SSD and TIGON3 have been validated. It is not
recommended to use other PCIe devices(Not mentioned in this website) because it
might bring the board with a little electrical instability on ZCU102 Rev 1.0.

8.8 GPU
-------

3D-graphics apps call Mali-libs API(libmali-xlnx) to drive the Mali400 GPU
directly by Mali400 kernel driver.
Some of mesa-demos test cases can be used to validate this function under limitation,
but we just keep this part as-is without further debugging since only binary
libs are available.

Due to the software license terms, we are not permitted to redistribute the
libmali-xlnx components. Due to this, we are unable to support the components
or directly enable them within Wind River Linux. Please contact your silicon
vendor if you have any questions about the libmali-xlnx software license terms.

As below is the step how to build a graphics enabled system:

  1) set BB_NO_NETWORK as '0' in <path-of-project>/build/conf/local.conf file.

  2) Launch bitbake to build an image with graphics support

     $ cd path_to_your_project
     $ . ./environment-setup-x86_64-wrlinuxsdk-linux
     $ . ./oe-init-build-env
     $ cat << _EOF >> conf/local.conf
DISTRO ?= "wrlinux-graphics"
PREFERRED_PROVIDER_virtual/mesa:xilinx-zynqmp = "mesa-gl"
PREFERRED_PROVIDER_virtual/libgl:xilinx-zynqmp = "mesa-gl"
PREFERRED_PROVIDER_virtual/libgles1:xilinx-zynqmp = "libmali-xlnx"
PREFERRED_PROVIDER_virtual/libgles2:xilinx-zynqmp = "libmali-xlnx"
PREFERRED_PROVIDER_virtual/egl:xilinx-zynqmp = "libmali-xlnx"
WRL_RECIPES:xilinx += "libmali-xlnx"
WRL_RECIPES:xilinx += 'kernel-module-mali'
LICENSE_FLAGS_ACCEPTED += "xilinx"
_EOF
     $ bitbake wrlinux-image-std-sato

8.9 SATA
---------

When your SATA hard disk data is corrupted, the system might report a hard link
reset, then try the following command:

     $ echo "- - -" > /sys/class/scsi_host/host1/scan
       ata2: hard resetting link
       ata2: SATA link down (SStatus 0 SControl 330)
       ata2: EH complete

And mkfs a new filesystem on your hard disk partition.

9 FPGA Bitstream File Update
============================

On xilinx-zynqmp platform, customer is able to update their own FPGA design image
from linux side in running time. A simple example as below:

9.1 Prepare FPGA bitstream file
---------------------------------

Download a xilinx prebuilt bitstream file with below link:
https://xilinx-wiki.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/A/pages/183304302/2019.2+Release
Then, extract the .bit file from package 2019.2-zcu102-release.tar.xz and rename it into system.bit

9.2 Generate binary file
--------------------------

Because xilinx-zynqmp platform only supports binary format for updating FPGA, it is need
to change the .bit file into binary format with below commands:
 - set environment variable
 # source xxx/Vivado/Vivado/2019.2/settings64.sh

 - generate the .bin from .bit file using Bootgen
 # bootgen -image Bitstream.bif -arch zynqmp -process_bitstream bin	(For 2017.4 and earlier releases)
 or
 # bootgen -image Bitstream.bif -arch zynqmp -o ./system.bit.bin -w	(For newer releases than 2017.4)

 - Bitstream.bif file content as below:
 all:
 {
	[destination_device = pl] system.bit	/* Bitstream file name */
 }

 - The output bin file is system.bit.bin

9.3 Generate Device Tree Overlay (DTO)
---------------------------------------

As below is the file contents example:

// pl.dtsi overlay dts file.
/dts-v1/;
/plugin/;

/ {
    fragment@0 {
        target-path = "/fpga-full";

        __overlay__ {
            #address-cells = <2>;
            #size-cells = <2>;

            firmware-name = "system.bit.bin";
        };
    };
};

We can create Device Tree Overlay Blob (.dtbo) file from
the pl.dtsi file as below:

dtc -O dtb -o pl.dtbo -b 0 -@ pl.dtsi

9.4 Deploy required files
---------------------------
Deploy system.bit.bin and pl.dtbo file in SD card or other storage medium.

9.5 Update FPGA bitstream file
--------------------------------
9.5.1 Update FPGA by using device tree overlay
Boot up kernel and login, then run below commands in terminal.
1) Set flags for Full Bitstream.
	# echo 0 > /sys/class/fpga_manager/fpga0/flags

2) Copy the Full Bitstream (.bin) and pl.dtbo files into firmware folder
	# mkdir -p /lib/firmware
	# cp xxx/system.bit.bin /lib/firmware/system.bit.bin
	# cp xxx/pl.dtbo /lib/firmware/pl.dtbo

3) Apply overlay DTB(pl.dtbo) to add live device nodes
	# mkdir /sys/kernel/config/device-tree/overlays/system
	# cd /lib/firmware/
	# echo pl.dtbo > /sys/kernel/config/device-tree/overlays/system/path

4) Steps to remove device nodes
	# rmdir /sys/kernel/config/device-tree/overlays/system

9.5.2 Update FPGA by using sysfs interface
Boot up kernel and login, then run below commands in terminal.
# echo 0 > /sys/class/fpga_manager/fpga0/flags
# mkdir -p /lib/firmware
# cp xxx/system.bit.bin /lib/firmware/system.bit.bin
# cd /lib/firmware
# echo system.bit.bin > /sys/class/fpga_manager/fpga0/firmware

9.6 Note
---------
If customer wants to enable new peripherals that reside in the new FPGA bitstream from linux side,
overlay solution is able to implement the requirement. Detail description, please refer to below link.
https://xilinx-wiki.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/A/pages/18841847/Solution+ZynqMP+PL+Programming#x-Programming+the+PL+through+Linux


10 Generate dtb based on HDF/XSA
================================
Firstly, set BB_NO_NETWORK as '0' in <path-of-project>/build/conf/local.conf file.
Then following the steps as below to generate the dtb files based on the HDF/XSA files:

     $ cd path-of-project
     $ . ./environment-setup-x86_64-wrlinuxsdk-linux
     $ . ./oe-init-build-env
     $ cat << _EOF >> conf/local.conf
WRL_RECIPES:xilinx += 'device-tree'
WRL_RECIPES:xilinx += 'python3-dtc'
WRL_RECIPES:xilinx-tools += 'external-hdf'
HDF_BASE = "file://"
HDF_PATH = "/< path-to-hdf >/system.xsa"
HDF_MACHINE = "zcu102-zynqmp"
_EOF
     $ bitbake device-tree

Once bitbake successfully, you will find the dtb file "system.dtb" in the directory:
<path-of-project>/build/tmp-glibc/deploy/images/xilinx-zynqmp/system.dtb

NOTE: Please make sure the version of the xsct tools is in accordance with the version
of HDF/XSA files, and there may be some unpredictable problems if using the HDF/XSA
files of older versions.

11.4 CSU Introduction
===================
Hardware CSU processor embedded in ZynqMP SoC to handle security stuffs

ZynqMP holds a triple redundant microblaze processor CSU to handle some security
boottime stuffs like:

  * Interpret the boot header and eFuse registers to configure the system and
    do the validation of the public key and public key revocation.
  * Loading, authentication, decryption(optional) of the FSBL, u-boot, etc.
  * Configure the PL via PCAP & Keys management.
  * Tamper events detecting and response.

CSU module AES-GCM hardware engine supports confidentiality of the boot images
and SHA hardware accelerator implements the SHA-3 algorithm and produces a 384
bits digest, which is used together with the RSA accelerator to provide images
authentication.

Please refer to the chpater 12 in [3] for more secure boot information.


11.5. Using Xilinx Design tools to make BOOT.BIN with AES encryption and RSA signature
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Prerequisites:

  * RSA key pair related knowledges, like using openssl to make RSA key pair.
  * Please carefully read chapter 8, 11, 12 in [3], chapter 8 and 16 in [4],
    chapter 5 in [9] and all content of [5] in References section.
  * Download and install Xilinx SDK 2019.1 or later version via link [7].

After having downloaded and installed Xilinx SDK, then you can start to make
RSA key pair and assemble your own zynqmp BOOT.BIN by bootgen command.

11.5.1. Using bootgen in Xilinx Design tools
--------------------------------------------
Set environment with below command:

   $ source <path_to_XSDK>/settings64.sh

After setting environment, customer is able to generate RSA 4096 key pairs
and BOOT.bin according to the doc [4], [5] and [9].
The following are some simple examples:

 - Generate RSA 4096 key pairs

   $ bootgen -generate_keys auth pem -arch zynqmp -image generate_pem.bif

 - Generate sha3 degist value

   $ bootgen -image generate_hash_ppk.bif -arch zynqmp -w -o test.bin -efuseppkbits sha3.txt

 - Generate BOOT.BIN for key stored in BBRAM

   $ bootgen -image generate_secure_boot_bbram.bif -arch zynqmp -w -o BOOT.BIN

 - Generate BOOT.BIN for key stored in eFUSE

   $ bootgen -image generate_secure_boot_efuse.bif -arch zynqmp -w -o BOOT.BIN

 - Generate BOOT.BIN for key stored in boot header

   $ bootgen -image generate_secure_boot_bh.bif -arch zynqmp -w -o BOOT.BIN

Note:
All the *.bif files and keys are in BSP layer xilinx-zynqmp/zynqmp_keys.

Warning:
  * BH RSA Option(In chapter 12 of [3]), is only used for integration and test
    support. The corresponding bit set keyword is bh_auth_enable in *.bif used
    by bootgen. The consequently result is that the PPK and SPK-ID
    will not be verified for authentication, so clearly this mode should not be
    used in final product.
    If this option is set in the configuration file and meanwhile the eFUSE is
    programmed to force authentication with "RSA_EN" by Xilinx Tools, this device
    will go into lockdown during boot.


11.5.2 Detail steps about how to generate secure bootloader(BOOT.BIN)
---------------------------------------------------------------------
Below example describes how to generate BOOT.BIN and the black key is stored
in boot header.

11.5.2.1 Generate First Stage Boot Loader

	$ bootgen -image generate_secure_boot_bh.bif -arch zynqmp -w -o BOOT.BIN


11.6. Programming BBRAM and eFUSE
---------------------------------
After all the development effort, it is recommend to use BBRAM or eFUSE to
save key for protecting product. About how to burn BBRAM and eFUSE, please
refer to [5].


11.7. A verifiable fitimage
---------------------------

u-boot uses rsa2048/rsa4096 cryptographic algorithms to 'sign' software images.
Images are signed with a private key of the ras2048/rsa4096 key pair that is only
owned by the signer, but can be verified by anyone who has the public key.
In wrlinux, the fitImage is signed with private key during building linux-yocto kernel.
The public key is combined with u-boot.dtb that is in the final image u-boot.elf.
The signature and verification process as follows:


      Signing                                      Verification
      =======                                      ============

Note:
 - To sign kernel image, Xilinx secure boot feature supports rsa2048 and rsa4096 key type.
   Set KERNEL_RAS_TYPE as the expected value. The default one is rsa2048.


11.8. Enable secure boot for BSP xilinx-zynqmp
----------------------------------------------

11.8.1 Build xilinx-zynqmp BSP project with secure-boot template
----------------------------------------------------------------
Detail steps as below:
	$ mkdir <path_to_project>
	$ cd <path_to_project>
	$ <path_to_wrlinux>/wrlinux-x/setup.sh --machine xilinx-zynqmp --distro wrlinux --dl-layers --all-layers --accept-eula=yes --templates feature/secure-boot
	$ source ./environment-setup-x86_64-wrlinuxsdk-linux
	$ source ./oe-init-build-env
	$ bitbake wrlinux-image-std

Note:
When building xilinx-zynqmp BSP project with secure-boot template, the kernel image type is fitImage that
includes dtb and kernel image. They are all signed by the private key of a RSA-2048/RSA-4096 key that is in
<path_to_project>/layers/xilinx-zynqmp/zynqmp_keys/fitImage-rsa2048-keys and
<path_to_project>/layers/xilinx-zynqmp/zynqmp_keys/fitImage-rsa4096-keys

11.8.2 Boot fitImage
--------------------
The fitImage is booted with command "bootm".
There is an example as below, download kernel from tftp server and mount NFS file system.

	# setenv bootargs console=ttyPS0,115200n8 root=/dev/nfs rw rootwait earlycon=cdns,0xFF000000 nfsroot=$serverip:<path_to_nfs>,v3,tcp ip=dhcp clk_ignore_unused
	# setenv bootcmd 'tftpboot 0x10000000 $serverip:<path_to_kernel>/fitImage; bootm 0x10000000'
	# setenv ipaddr <board-ip>
	# setenv netmask <board-netmask>
	# setenv gatewayip <board-gatewayip>
	# setenv serverip <server-ip>
	# run bootcmd

There is another example based on wic image, load kernel from sd boot partition and mount file system from /dev/mmcblk0p2.

	# setenv bootfile fitImage
	# setenv loadaddr 0x10000000
	# setenv bootargs console=ttyPS0,115200n8 root=/dev/mmcblk0p2 rw earlycon=cdns,0xFF000000 ip=dhcp clk_ignore_unused
	# setenv bootcmd 'fatload mmc 0:1 $loadaddr $bootfile; bootm $loadaddr'
	# run bootcmd

11.9. Notes
-----------

Only encryption and authentication part of CSU are validated, other functions
like tamper event detection and response belongs to CSU bootrom codes, please
contact Xilinx for more information about CSU. Only boot header mode(A black
key stored in boot header) is validated currently.

Risks warning from UG1085, once program efuse wrongly, the board might enter
into a secure lockdown state if SEC_LK is programmed into eFuse. Please refer
to Chapter 8, 11, and 12 in [3] for more security related information.

Not all secure function modules are validated due to hardware resource issue,
like the following:
  SEC_LK, JTAG_DIS, ERR_DIS, BBRAM_DIS, ENC_ONLY, etc.
